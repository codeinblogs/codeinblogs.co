                        Let's get started with some basic questions.<br><br>
                        Why do you need E-Payments?<br><br>
                        An e-payment account provides some other way to send and receive money online. A growing
                        quantity of human beings uses e-payment organizations because they could make it less difficult
                        to transfer cash and make purchases. They also mean you don't have to share your card details.
                        <br><br>
                        You have a website related to E-commerce, and your client wants to make a transaction. How will
                        he do? Is he going to ask you for your UPI ID? Or will he travel for kilometers so that he can
                        pay you cash?
                        <br><br>
                        If you have a Woocommerce payment gateway, your client can make the payment from its most
                        comfortable zone, just like other big companies accept payments.

                        What is a WordPress online payment gateway?<br>
                        Payment gateways are the third-party service companies that permit you to accept online bills
                        for your eCommerce store. However, now not all of them have the same policies, processing
                        charges, and features. Choosing an unsuitable payment gateway will increase your costs and hurt
                        your enterprise's lengthy period.<br><br>
                        The Pros and The Cons of Online Payment<br><br>
                        Pros<br><br>
                        If you compare E-payment with cash payment, you will find that E-payment is more manageable,
                        more comfortable, and suitable for everyone in this pandemic condition.
                        As you know, it is the quickest way to pay anyone. As compared to cash transactions, online
                        payment is better, and it has a one-click payment process.

                        shopkeepers, and people in business.
                        <br><br>
                        Cons<br><br>
                        Sometimes, you have to face an internet connection problem which is a technical fault.
                        Sometimes, your bank's server fails so that you cannot pay anyone at that time, which is one of
                        the technical faults in your bank.<br>
                        Sometimes, hackers steal your payment information when your websites have no security. Sometimes
                        with inadequate validation, the hackers add some quotes and hack your payment information.
                        <br><br>
                        Various WordPress Payment Methods<br>
                        There are some various WordPress Payment Methods are as follows:<br><br>

                        PayPal<br><br>

                        PayPal is a web payment platform that operates in 202 international locations. PayPal makes it
                        less complicated as a way to receive bills in 25 currencies in recent times.
                        <br><br>
                        Therefore, the likelihood that a WordPress charge gateway is offered for you to know your
                        location is very high. The consistent $30/mo carrier charges are deducted from your bank account
                        for the PayPal gateway.
                        <br><br>
                        The processing charge and transaction gateway depends on your financial institution account and
                        the volume of your enterprise.
                        <br><br>
                        As you understand, PayPal is offering 24Ã—7 superior encryption, fraud protection, and account
                        tracking so that PayPal users are free from those troubles. The motto of PayPal is to give their
                        customers the best service possible and reaching their comfort zone for making any transaction.

                        <br><br>
                        Stripe
                        <br><br>
                        Stripe is also up WordPress Payment Methods, which is one of the strongest challengers of
                        PayPal. Stripe is in business use in over 26 nations. If it is available in your area, you are
                        capable of taking delivery of bills out of your clients in greater than 135 international
                        locations around the sector.
                        <br><br>
                        The transaction is charged by way of Stripe. However, suppose the average transaction size is
                        small on your internet site. In that case, the history of PayPal costs decreases transaction
                        discipline.<br>
                        Stripe charges a low quantity of transaction rate from every customer. These customers charge
                        $10 or less than $10 as a processing fee. You do not require any merchant account to acquire
                        your money, and it's automatically transferred to your connected account.
                        Authorize.Net is one of the famous and PCI-certified plugins available for an initial setup of
                        $49. You may be charged $ 25 per month as a monthly price and maintain this plugin very well.
                        <br><br>
                        Authorize.Net integrates very quickly with the opposite plugins like Magneto, Shopify,
                        QuickBooks, and Moolah. It isn't like Stripe. Here, you have to make a merchant account to
                        acquire bills from Authorize.Net robotically.<br><br>
                        Square<br><br>
                        Square is one of the more affordable and comfortable payment gateways. Square has
                        free-to-download WordPress Payment Plugins that charges no monthly fees, which is very
                        beneficial for every WordPress user.<br><br>

                        How Gateways works?<br><br>

                        Accepting payments on your Woocommerce platform will open up many opportunities for you to earn
                        more. Let's see how it works.<br><br>
                        Here's how it works:<br><br>
                        Customer adds a product or service from your website to the cart<br>
                        They will enter checkout and select a payment method.
                        It invites the payment gateway, which appears to your customers
                        The customer fills in their payment details in the gateway app. It could be a credit card,
                        PayPal login, or something else
                        The gateway securely transfers the fund data to its native servers
                        The payment server authorizes or declines the payments after contacting the credit card servers
                        or PayPal<br><br>
                        If it authorizes the payment, the gateway is informed that the fund is in transit
                        The payment gateway informs your eCommerce site of payment acceptance.
                        Your website informs the customer that the product or service has been released for download or
                        delivery.
                        The gateway then transfers the funds to your bank account
                        The transaction is complete
                        <br><br>
