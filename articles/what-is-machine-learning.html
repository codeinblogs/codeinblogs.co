                        future relies heavily on our ability to deploy artificial intelligence (AI) successfully.
                        However, transforming machines into thinking devices is not as easy as it may seem. Strong AI
                        can only be achieved with machine learning (ML) to help machines understand as humans do.

                        Machine learning can be confusing, so it is important that we begin by clearly defining the
                        term: <br>

                    <h1 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl xl:text-4xl  font-semibold">How does Machine Learning
                        Work?

                    <br>


                    <p class="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl font-normal poppins">
                        Similar to how the human brain gains knowledge and understanding, machine learning relies on
                        input, such as training data or knowledge graphs, to understand entities, domains and the
                        connections between them. With entities defined, deep learning can begin.

                        The machine learning process begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct
                        experience or instruction. It looks for patterns in data so it can later make inferences based
                        on the examples provided. The primary aim of ML is to allow computers to learn autonomously
                        without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.</p>

                    <h1 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl xl:text-4xl  font-semibold">Why Is Machine Learning
                        Important?</h1>

                    <br>
                    <p class="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl font-normal poppins">Machine learning as a concept has been around
                        for quite some time. The term “machine learning”
                        was coined by Arthur Samuel, a computer scientist at IBM and a pioneer in AI and computer
                        gaming. Samuel designed a computer program for playing checkers. The more the program played,
                        the more it learned from experience, using algorithms to make predictions. <br> <br>

                        As a discipline, machine learning explores the analysis and construction of algorithms that can
                        learn from and make predictions on data. <br><br>

                        ML has proven valuable because it can solve problems at a speed and scale that cannot be
                        duplicated by the human mind alone. With massive amounts of computational ability behind a
                        single task or multiple specific tasks, machines can be trained to identify patterns in and
                        relationships between input data and automate routine processes.

                                algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as “training data,” to
                                make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. This can
                                reveal
